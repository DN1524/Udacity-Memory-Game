# Memory Game Project
The goal of this game is to match all 16 cards to win. You are scored with 1-3 stars based on how many moves you make to complete the game. When you complete the game, a modal will appear showing your score and time. This game requires internet connection to load the icons such as the card icons, stars, and reset button.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
